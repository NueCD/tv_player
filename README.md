# tv_player
Play videos that are added from a web page. 

## Requirements
- mpv
- python3

## How to use
Run player.sh in foreground or background.
Must be started along with X or wayland.
Go to the website http://server_ip:8000/ and queue links.
It should work with nfs links as well but I have not tried.
